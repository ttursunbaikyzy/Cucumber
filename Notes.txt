JBDC notes-
recap -
mysql connector java is the dependency we have added

we need 3 things to work with DB
address of DB - url
Name of DB
Username, password

Connection class - to establish the connection with DB
make a statement - it allows to send the query to the DB
resultset - the result will be stored in its object

rset.next()- to shift the cursor on to the next line/row

resultMetData - it contains the information about the result as
how many columns are there, how many rows, name of columns/rows etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
to integrate with framework, we will pass url, username and password in the config.properties file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to integrate our db in framework, we create dbutility class

select emp_firstname, emp_lastname
from hr_hs_employee
where employee_id='12345'

we have added a scenario in addemployee feature file
we have added steps in add employee steps page
we have added tag of the scenario in runner class

scenario is to capture the employee id from UI
and verify it with the DB
for this, we have added scenario in feature file
and added in step definitions

then we are verifying, middlename, lastname etc one by one
because we cannot compare bunch of values in one attempt
